        <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>nrconfig is a command-line tool intended to support creating and maintaining <a href="https://newrelic.com/docs/dotnet/CustomInstrumentation.html">custom instrumentation</a> files for use by New Relic.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> I'm not affiliated with New Relic, Inc beyond being a happy customer of theirs and this tool is in no way endorsed or sanctioned by them. If there are issues with the tool or questions about the source, come to me and not their (lovely) support team as they'll not know what you're talking about.</p>

<h2>Quickstart from NuGet</h2>

<p>Minimally, grab the NRConfig.Tool NuGet package:</p>

<pre><code>PM&gt; install-package NRConfig.Tool
</code></pre>

<p>This will make the nrconfig.exe command available to your post-build steps for all projects in your solution. Next step's up to you - if you want fine-grained control of which methods get instrumented, also grab the NRConfig.Library NuGet package for each project you want to instrument:</p>

<pre><code>PM&gt; install-package NRConfig.Library
</code></pre>

<p>Then mark up your classes or methods with [NRConfig.Instrument] attributes before adding a post-build step for your project:</p>

<pre><code>nrconfig.exe /i $(TargetPath) /o $(TargetDir)$(TargetName).NewRelic.xml
</code></pre>

<h3>Don't need fine-grained control?</h3>

<p>If you don't need method-level specificity, you can use the /f flag in the post-build step (flags are described below):</p>

<pre><code>nrconfig.exe /i $(TargetPath) /f all /o $(TargetDir)$(TargetName).NewRelic.xml
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Mark up your methods for fine-grained control</h3>

<p>If you want to instrument specific methods or all of the methods within specific classes then the best approach is to mark them up with Instrument attributes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Install the NRConfig.Library NuGet package into the projects you wish to instrument</li>
<li>Annotate at the assembly, class or method level with the [Instrument] attribute</li>
<li>Install the NRConfig.Tool NuGet package</li>
<li>Run nrconfig.exe against the assemblies in question</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note</strong> See the Limitations section at the end for important caveats about this approach.</p>

<pre><code>nrconfig /i *.dll
</code></pre>

<h3>Generate instrumentation files for unadorned assemblies</h3>

<p>If you can't or don't want to change your code, or want to quickly get a baseline instrumentation configuration file that you can then tweak manually then you can use the /f flag.</p>

<pre><code>nrconfig /i *.dll /f [filters]
</code></pre>

<p>where [filters] is one or more of:</p>

<ul>
<li>all</li>
<li>methods</li>
<li>properties</li>
<li>constructors</li>
</ul><p>separated by spaces, and where each of those can be followed immediately by a + or - to limit processing to public or non-public targets only. So, to instrument all public methods and properties in any class in an assembly:</p>

<pre><code>nrconfig /i MyAssembly.dll /f methods+ properties+
</code></pre>

<p>while to instrument all methods, whether public or private:</p>

<pre><code>nrconfig /i MyAssembly.dll /f methods+-
</code></pre>

<h3>Merge multiple configuration files</h3>

<p>The filter format is pretty basic, and you might want to use different filters for different assemblies. You can do that by running nrconfig multiple times with different output files specified, then merge them with the /m flag:</p>

<pre><code>REM Instrument all methods in FirstAssembly, 
REM and public ones in SecondAssembly
nrconfig /i FirstAssembly.dll /f methods+- /o FirstAssembly.NewRelic.xml
nrconfig /i SecondAssembly.dll /f methods+ /o SecondAssembly.NewRelic.xml

REM Merge the two files
nrconfig /m /i *.NewRelic.xml /o MergedInstrumentation.xml
</code></pre>

<h3>Options</h3>

<h4>/i &lt;file_1&gt; [file_2] ... [file_n]</h4>

<p>Specifies the input files to be processed. These can either be specific paths, include wildcard strings in the filename portion or include environment variables.</p>

<p>If used in conjunction with the /m switch the files specified by /i must be XML documents previously generated by nrconfig.</p>

<h4>/o &lt;outputpath&gt;</h4>

<p>Specifies the output filename. If /o isn't specified, a file called CustomInstrumentation.xml will be generated in the current directory.</p>

<h4>/f &lt;filter1&gt; [filter2]</h4>

<p>Specifies that all methods, constructors and properties matched by the filters should be instrumented even if they haven't been annotated by [Instrument] attributes. Each filter must be from the set:</p>

<ul>
<li>all</li>
<li>properties</li>
<li>methods</li>
<li>constructors</li>
</ul><p>and each can be immediately followed by + or - (or both) signifying public or non-public respectively. If neither + nor - is specified, + is assumed.</p>

<h4>/m</h4>

<p>Merges input instrumentation files into a single output file.</p>

<h4>/v</h4>

<p>Verbose mode, shows a little more diagnostic information during the run.</p>

<h4>/debug</h4>

<p>Extra-verbose mode, generates a lot of console output but useful if you're about to report a bug.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>There are a few quirks of the output to deal with issues around New Relic's profiler and its handling of generics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generic classes aren't supported</li>
<li>If a method that takes a generic type as a parameter, which itself has more than one type parameter (like Dictionary, rather than IEnumerable) then all overloads of that method will be instrumented too even if they aren't configured to be - this works around an issue where methods of this type can't be expressed in the configuration file in a way</li>
